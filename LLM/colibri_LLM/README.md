**Tiny engine, immense model.** Run **GLM-5.2 (744B-parameter MoE)** on a consumer machine with ~25 GB of RAM — in pure C, with zero dependencies, by streaming experts from disk.

Colibrì is a lightweight, quality-preserving MoE runtime that treats VRAM, RAM,
and storage as one managed memory hierarchy. Insufficient fast memory may reduce
speed, but the default policy **never silently changes model precision or router
semantics**.

## The vision

Frontier models should not be sealed inside datacenters. colibrì exists so that
**anyone curious enough can open one up**: run a 744B-parameter mind on hardware
you already own, watch every expert fire in real time, and change the code that
does it. Not renting intelligence behind an API — *holding* it: probing it,
measuring it, improving it. Every optimisation in this project started with
someone measuring something on their own machine; the engine is deliberately
small enough that the next one can come from you.

## The idea

A 744B Mixture-of-Experts model activates only ~40B parameters per token — and
only ~11 GB of those change from token to token (the routed experts):

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/sparse.png" width="880" alt="only ~5.4% of parameters are active per token">
</p>

So the model doesn't need to *fit* in fast memory — it needs to be **placed**:

- the **dense part** (attention, shared experts, embeddings — ~17B params) stays
  **resident in RAM at int4** (~9.9 GB);
- the **19,456 routed experts** (75 MoE layers × 256 + the MTP head, ~19 MB each
  at int4) live **on disk** (~370 GB) and are **streamed on demand**, with a
  per-layer LRU cache, a learned pinned hot-store, and an optional VRAM tier.

Think of the core algorithm as **a JIT, but for weights**. A compiler JIT never
compiles the whole program — it watches what actually runs and compiles the hot
paths, just in time. colibrì makes the same bet about a 744B parameter space:
parameters are not resident state to be held, they are **data to be staged**
across a heterogeneous storage hierarchy (VRAM / RAM / NVMe), exactly when the
router proves they are needed. Measured routing heat decides which experts earn
which tier, the router runs a layer ahead so prefetch hides the staging latency,
and — like a JIT — the engine learns your workload: the more you run, the hotter
the right experts get. It works because routing has measurable structure (see
the [expert atlas](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/175)) — and
structure is cacheable.

The engine is a single C file (`c/glm.c`) plus small headers. No BLAS, no Python
at runtime, no GPU required.

## How it works

### The per-token path

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/token-path.png" width="880" alt="route → union → place → overlap → learn">
</p>

Every layer of every token walks the same five steps. The design goal is that
**placement only ever decides speed** — the router's decisions and the weights'
precision are the same whether an expert answered from VRAM or from disk.

### One memory hierarchy instead of one memory requirement

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/tiers.png" width="880" alt="VRAM / RAM / NVMe three-tier expert residency">
</p>

### Dual-SSD: two copies of the model, twice the read bandwidth

Decode is disk-bound on most machines, and expert reads are read-only — so if you have a **second SSD**, put a full copy of the model on it and let the engine stream from both drives at once:

```bash
COLI_MODEL=/fast/glm52_i4 COLI_MODEL_MIRROR=/second/glm52_i4 ./coli chat
COLI_DISK_WEIGHTS=9,3 ...   # optional: primary,mirror bandwidth ratio (else measured at startup)
```

Each expert is routed to one drive by a deterministic hash, weighted by the two drives' measured (or declared) bandwidth, so readahead/PILOT prefetch and the demand read always hit the same drive and nothing is cached twice. The aggregate bandwidth is the sum of both drives — a 9 GB/s + 3 GB/s pair reads experts ~33% faster than the fast drive alone, and the OMP-parallel pin/warmup load streams from both. Details worth knowing:

- the mirror is **validated at startup** (per-file size + safetensors header must be byte-identical to the primary); divergent or missing files silently stay on the primary, so a **partial mirror is fine** — a smaller second SSD holding only some shards still helps;
- the mirror is **never written**: `.coli_usage`, `.coli_kv` and all sidecars stay on the primary;
- a read error on the mirror falls back to the primary (one warning, no crash), so unplugging the second drive mid-run degrades instead of killing the server;
- routing never changes tokens — both copies are byte-identical, and the per-run `MIRROR:` stats line shows GB served per drive.

The same engine spans the whole range: on a 25 GB laptop everything streams from
disk (slow but correct); on a large host the entire expert set becomes resident
(`CUDA_EXPERT_GB=auto PIN_GB=all`) and disk drops out of the decode path
entirely. Between the tiers sits a **learning cache**: the engine records which
experts *your* workload routes to (`.coli_usage`, updated every turn) and pins
the hottest ones automatically — colibrì literally gets faster the more you use
it. On multi-socket hosts, `COLI_NUMA=1` interleaves the resident weights across
memory controllers ([#82](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/82)).

### Never wait for the disk twice

Misses are expensive, so the engine spends most of its cleverness avoiding and
overlapping them: each expert's three matrices are stored adjacent and read in
one `pread`; a bounded async I/O pool (`PIPE=1`, default) loads missing experts
while resident ones compute; batched positions read each unique expert once
(**batch-union**); and a router-lookahead thread (`PILOT=1`) prefetches the next
layer's experts — routing is measurably **71.6% predictable one layer ahead**.
On GPUs, the resident pipeline (`COLI_CUDA_PIPE=2`) keeps the residual stream
on-device across layers so the CPU expert loop runs uninterrupted; on Apple
Silicon an experimental [Metal backend](docs/metal.md) does the batched expert
math on the unified-memory GPU.

> **On real NVMe, measure `DIRECT=1`.** O_DIRECT bypasses the page cache and is
> often a large win on drives with DRAM cache and bandwidth headroom (+34%
> decode measured with `PIPE=1` on a Blackwell/Windows box; 4.25→9.69 GB/s in
> iobench on a GB10) — but it is drive-dependent: QLC/DRAM-less or virtualised
> disks can be neutral to negative. Try it first; keep what your hardware

### Faithful model, compressed state

The forward pass is validated **token-exact against a `transformers` oracle**
(teacher-forcing 32/32). MLA attention stores a compressed KV state — 576
floats/token instead of 32,768 (**57× smaller**) — and persists it across
restarts (`.coli_kv`): conversations reopen warm with zero re-prefill,
byte-identical to an uninterrupted session. DSA sparse attention (GLM-5.2's
lightning indexer) is implemented faithfully and validated by forcing full-key
selection to reproduce dense attention exactly.

### Speculative decoding, honestly

GLM-5.2's native MTP head drafts tokens that the main model verifies in one
batched forward — 2.2–2.8 tokens/forward when it pays. Two hard-won rules ship
as defaults: the MTP head must be **int8** (int4 heads collapse to 0–4%
acceptance, [#8](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/8)), and draft and
verify must compute **the same function** — `SPEC_PIN=1` pins both to one
kernel family ([#163](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/163) is the
full forensic story). Grammar-forced drafts
([`GRAMMAR=file.gbnf`](docs/grammar-draft.md)) add ~free acceptance on
constrained JSON output. Whether speculation is a net win depends on your
cache temperature — measure, and use `DRAFT=0` when it doesn't pay.

## What it achieves

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/ladder.png" width="880" alt="measured decode speed by hardware class">
</p>

Same engine, same int4 container — the hardware only changes where the experts
live. Highlights from the [full benchmark tables](docs/benchmarks.md):

- **6× RTX 5090, full residency:** 5.8–6.8 tok/s decode, TTFT ~13 s
  ([experiment log](docs/experiments/glm52-6x5090-2026-07-12.md));
- **128 GB CPU-only desktop:** ~1.8 tok/s warm ([#200](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/200));
- **single RTX 5070 Ti laptop-class box:** 1.07 tok/s via the GPU-resident
  pipeline ([#273](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/273));
- **25 GB dev box:** 0.05–0.1 tok/s cold — the proven floor where this project
  started, and still the honest baseline.

Quality is measured, not assumed: the int4 container's quantization cost and the
scale-granularity/rotation ablations live in
[docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md#quality-benchmark) and
[#108](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/108)/[#81](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/81).

## Get started

You need two things: **the program** (a few hundred KB) and **the model**
(372 GB). Step-by-step for every platform in the
[Quick Start guide](docs/quickstart.md).

### 1. Get colibri

**Download a prebuilt release** — Linux, macOS and Windows, no compiler needed.
Take the archive for your platform from
[Releases](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/releases) and unpack it:

```bash
mkdir colibri && tar xzf colibri-v1.1.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -C colibri && cd colibri
python3 coli info                         # engine ready ✓
```

Inside you get the engine (`colibri`, `colibri.exe` on Windows), the `coli`
launcher and its Python helpers. Nothing to rename or configure — `coli` finds
the engine next to itself. You only need
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed: the launcher and the
API gateway are Python scripts, while the engine itself is pure C with zero
dependencies.

**Or build from source** — needs `gcc` (or clang) with OpenMP:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri && cd colibri/c
./setup.sh                                # checks gcc/OpenMP, builds, self-tests
```

Want `coli` on your PATH? From a checkout, `pip install -e .` registers it (the
engine still lives in `c/` — an editable install from the clone, not a wheel).

### 2. Get the model

A pre-converted **GLM-5.2 int4** container is on Hugging Face — **use the
version with the int8 MTP heads**. It is about **372 GB**, so put it on a disk
with the room, ideally a fast one:

**https://huggingface.co/mateogrgic/GLM-5.2-colibri-int4-with-int8-mtp**

> ⚠️ The original mirror ships int4 MTP heads → 0% draft acceptance
> ([#8](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/8)). Check yours:
> `ls -l <model>/out-mtp-*` — int8 (correct) is `3527131672 / 5366238584 / 1065950496`.

Or convert from the FP8 source yourself — one resumable command that never needs
the full 756 GB on disk at once:

```bash
./coli convert --model /nvme/glm52_i4     # download+convert shard by shard (python, one-time)
```

### 3. Run it

```bash
COLI_MODEL=/nvme/glm52_i4 ./coli chat     # RAM budget, cache and MTP auto-detected
COLI_MODEL=/nvme/glm52_i4 ./coli plan     # inspect the planned VRAM/RAM/disk placement
COLI_MODEL=/nvme/glm52_i4 ./coli doctor   # read-only readiness check
./coli web  --model /nvme/glm52_i4        # API + web dashboard on one port
./coli serve --model /nvme/glm52_i4       # OpenAI-compatible API only
```

On Windows the same commands work with `python coli chat --model D:\glm52_i4`.
The engine at runtime is pure C — python is only used by the one-time converter
and the optional API gateway.

## What's next

- **Algorithmic research is active.** The current hierarchy is LRU + a learned
  pin set; the next step is under way — smarter placement and scheduling,
  overlap of CPU and GPU expert execution, and routing-aware speculation.
  Everything lands the way this project always works: measured, reviewed, and
  merged in the open.
- **More open models.** The tiering algorithm is model-agnostic: any MoE with
  routed experts can be staged the same way. GLM-5.2 and OLMoE run today;
  support for more open-weight families — **Kimi K2** (Moonshot AI),
  **Qwen3 MoE** (Alibaba), **MiniMax** — is on the roadmap.

## Why "colibrì"

The hummingbird weighs a few grams, hovers in place, and visits a thousand
flowers a day. This engine keeps a 744-billion-parameter giant alive on
hummingbird rations: 25 GB of RAM, twelve CPU cores, and a lot of disk patience.
